It computes reaction constants and rates of progress for all reactions and calculates the net production rate, or source terms, for all chemical species. Furthermore, it provides an interface for gas-aerosol interactions that allows coupling with aerosol models. TChem-atm automatically calculates the Jacobian matrix for source terms using either finite differences (numerical Jacobian) or automatic differentiation (analytical Jacobian via SACADO). Furthermore, the computation of the source term and associated Jacobian is independent of the time integration solver in TChem-atm. As such, TChem-atm provides an interface for time-stepping solutions (Box model) for the Tines, CVODE, and Kokkos-kernels libraries.
