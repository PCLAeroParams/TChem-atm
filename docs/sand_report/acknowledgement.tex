TChem-atm has been developed using the following funding sources:

\begin{itemize}

\item Sandia Laboratory Directed Research and Development (LDRD) projects "Bridging aerosol representations across scales with physics-constrained statistical learning" and "Benchmarking TChem for Potential Incorporation into E3SM as a Replacement Chemical Kinetics Solver."

\item The EAGLES project (https://climatemodeling.science.energy.gov/projects/enabling-aerosol-cloud-interactions-global-convection-permitting-scales-eagles), which was funded by
the Office of Science's Biological and Environmental
Research (https://science.osti.gov/ber) Program.

\item Exascale Catalytic Chemistry ECC Project; https://www.ecc-project.org/.

\end{itemize}


This work was supported by the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program at
Sandia National Laboratories, a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National
Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell
International Inc. for the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s National Nuclear Security Administration
under contract DE-NA0003525.
